# GraphQL API With Cosmos DB Backend 
## What is the purpose of this template?
One stop template for anyone wanting to create a GraphQL API in .NET that connects to multiple CosmosDb instances to fetch data.

## Target architecture
![Target architecture](https://github.com/dotnet-azure-starters/graphql-api-cosmosdb-backend/blob/main/GraphQlArchitecture.png)

### Prerequisites
- [What is GraphQL]
- [What is Hot Chocolate GraphQL Server For .NET]
- [What is Cosmos DB]
- [What is schema stitching] (when merging data from multiple Cosmos DB instances)
- [GraphQL schema first design] (design your schema first and then develop the code to fulfil the schema)

### Features
- Schema first GraphQL .NET API
- Connects to multiple CosmosDb instances to get data
- Integrates to Azure App Insights for all logging and telemetry
- Full scaffolding setup with resolvers for schema first GraphQL queries
- Scaffolding for data schema and Cosmos DB repositories
- Scaffolding for domain model
- Domain model to data model mapping
- Paging support when returning a large data set

### TODO
- Add support for OAuth
- Implement the repository pattern when connecting to multiple Cosmos DB's
- Add support to connect to other data sources such as SQL Server, MySQL etc


> Please be aware, this is still work in progress and not ready for a production scenario

> Any contributions or input will be much appreciated
